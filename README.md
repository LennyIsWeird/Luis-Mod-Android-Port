When Downloading The APK The Game Will Give You A Download Popup, If You Accept It You Will Break The App, Thats Why I Made An Already Ready To Use Backup.
You Gotta Make A Folder In The Internal Memory, It Shoud Look Like This (0/LuisMod/Licence/Backup) Once You Do That You Can Boot The Game, The Loading Screen Will Take A Bit On First Bootup, But Nothing To Worry About, Its Just Installing The Licences. Done, You Can Now Play LuisMod In Android.
